# Soundboard

The easiest way to test the application is to install [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) on your mobile phone form Apple or Google Store. Then go to this [link](https://expo.dev/@yousoumar/soundboard) and scan the QR Code.

## Features

The application has two main scrrens. **Pads** which prints pads in a grid. A pad has a sound related to it, plays it when it's cliked. A long press on a pad opens a modal, which allows to edit it. We can choose a different song from some default ones, from [Fresound API](https://freesound.org), or record. **Samples** which shows all songs whe have in our library that we can use, sorted by `All`, `Default`, `Recorded` and `External` songs.

## Challenge

An optimized UI, instantaneous searches, organised code base with everything typed, a clean commit history, and many others :)
